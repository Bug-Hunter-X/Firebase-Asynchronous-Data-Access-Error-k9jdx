# Firebase Asynchronous Data Access Error

This repository demonstrates a common error in Firebase when dealing with asynchronous data retrieval.  Accessing data before the asynchronous operation completes results in undefined behavior. The solution showcases the proper way to handle asynchronous operations using promises or async/await.

## Bug
The bug occurs when attempting to access data from a Firebase query immediately after initiating the query.  Since Firebase operations are asynchronous, the data might not be available yet, leading to errors or unexpected results.

## Solution
The solution involves using `.then()` for promises or `async/await` to ensure that the data is fetched successfully before accessing it.  This prevents errors and allows for reliable data handling.
